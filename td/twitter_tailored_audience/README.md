# Workflow: td example (Result Output to Twitter Tailored Audience)

This example workflow outputs data to a twitter tailorerd audience using [Writing Job Results into your Twitter Tailored Audience](https://docs.treasuredata.com/display/public/INT/Twitter+Tailored+Audience+Export+Integration) with [td](https://docs.digdag.io/operators/td.html) operator.

# Prerequisites

The connection name is used in the dig file.

# How to Run

First, please upload your workflow project by `td wf push` command.

    # Upload
    $ td wf push twitter_tailored_audience

If you want to mask any settings, please set it by `td wf secrets` command. For more details, please see [digdag documentation](https://docs.digdag.io/command_reference.html#secrets)

    # Set Secrets
    $ td wf secrets --project twitter_tailored_audience --set key

    # Set Secrets on your local for testing
    $ td wf secrets --local --set key

Now you can use these secrets by `${secret:}` syntax in the dig file.

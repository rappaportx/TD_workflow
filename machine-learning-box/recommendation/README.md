Top-k Item Recommendation Template
===

**Top-k recommendation** is an important task to improve customers' engagement in online services.

This page introduces a workflow template to get top-k item recommendation for each user. You can easily build a recommendation workflow following this guide.

## Input

This workflow takes a table of the following form:

| userid<br/>`long` | itemid<br/>`long` | rating<br/>`float/double` |
|---:|---:|:---:|
|3077|2046|4.0|
|3078|1252|4.0|
|3078|736|1.0|
| ... |...|...|

_**Caution:** `rating` would be the number of clicks/views/conversions/boughts/scores depending on your problem._

The table should be named `input` that includes userid of type `long`, itemid of type `long`, and rating of type `float/double`. You can use [map_id.dig](./map_id.dig) for creating those id mapping from the original user/item representation.

## Workflow

We prepared a basic workflow for top-k item recommendation.

```sh
$ ./data.sh
$ td wf push recommendation # push workflow to TD
$ td wf start recommendation recommend --session now
```

* [recommend.dig](recommend.dig) - TD workflow script for top-k item recommendation using [Matrix Factorization](https://docs.treasuredata.com/display/public/PD/MovieLens+20M+Rating+Prediction+by+Matrix+Factorization)
* [config/params.yml](config/params.yml) - defines configurable parameters for the recommendation workflow such as `k` of top-k. By the default, the workflow recommends top-10 items for each user.

### Workflow with PySpark

You also can try [Spark.ml collaborative filtering](https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.0/ml-collaborative-filtering.html) recommendation for top-k item recommendation. Ensure both [Python Custom Scripting](https://docs.treasuredata.com/display/public/PD/Introduction+to+Custom+Scripts) and [td-spark](https://docs.treasuredata.com/display/public/PD/Using+Apache+Spark+Driver+%28TD-Spark%29+in+your+Spark+Environment) enabled.

```sh
$ ./data.sh
$ td wf push recommendation
$ td wf secrets --project recommendation --set td.apikey --set td.apiserver
# Set secrets from STDIN like: td.apikey=1/xxxxx, td.apiserver=https://api.treasuredata.com
$ td wf start recommendation recommend_spark --session now
```

* [recommend_spark.dig](recommend_spark.dig) - TD workflow script for top-k item recommendation using [Matrix Factorization](https://docs.treasuredata.com/display/public/PD/MovieLens+20M+Rating+Prediction+by+Matrix+Factorization)
* [recommend.py](py_scripts/recommend.py) - Python script for PySpark ALS recommendation.
* [config/params.yml](config/params.yml) - Configurable parameters for the recommendation workflow. This workflow uses `k` of top-k and `target` as database name. By the default, the workflow recommends top-10 items for each user.


## Output

The output of workflow is a table that contains a list of recommended items for each user as shown below:

| userid<br/>`long` | recommended_items<br/>`array<long>` |
|:---:|:---|
| 10 |[4454,2609,1214,1949,33539,7079,2324,224,3989,26939]|
| 11 |[1035,8580,720,40815,50160,150,3675,31485,8970,7080]|
| 12 |[4886,1721,27611,8636,4226,356,296,2396,2501,6776]|
| ... |...|

# How to Run
First, upload the project.

    # Upload
    $ td wf push kick_another_account_workflow_kohki

Second, register target account's api key as a workflow secret.

    # Set secrets
    $ td wf secrets --project kick_another_account_workflow_kohki --set td.another_account_apikey

Now, you can refer to api key as ${secret:td.another_account_apikey}.

Finaly, you can trigger the session manually.

    # Run
    $ td wf start kick_another_account_workflow_kohki kick_another_account_workflow_kohki --session now

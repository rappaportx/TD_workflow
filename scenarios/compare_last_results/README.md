# Workflow: Scenario (Compare the results of td jobs)

## Scenario

The purpose of this scenario is to compare the results of different td queries.
The `store_last_results` can store the first 1 row of the query results to ${td.last_results} variable. However it will be unavailable if following `td>` operator uses `store_last_results`. If you want to compare the last results between different jobs, you need to split the tasks.

*Steps*
1. Run a query with `store_last_results` parameter.
2. Keep a stored last result to variable using `for_each>` operator.
3. Run an another query with `store_last_results` parameter as subtask in `for_each>`.
4. Compare the results using `if>` operator.

In this scenario, some workflow operators are used. Please refer to the documentation for each operator.

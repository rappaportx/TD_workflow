# Tapad data ingestion and id mapping creation
This workflow gets Tapad DGA file from their SFTP server and makes id mapping of cookies and idfa/adids by SQLs on TD.

## Prerequisites
### Cookie sync with Tapad
You need to sync your cookie which basically td_client_id or td_global_id with [Tapad](https://help.tapad.com/articles/cookie-syncing).
Please contact your TD Solution Architect to get customized td-js-sdk tag for cookie syncing.

### Tapad credentials and parameters
You also need to have following Tapad credentials and parameters to set those information in your [tapad_data_ingestion.dig](tapad_data_ingestion.dig) file.	

- sftp username
- sftp password
- DGA filename prefix
- Cookie prefix

### Push workflow and set secret
Download this workflow and push it to your TD environment, then set your sftp password as secret on the project.
```
$ td wf push tapad_data_ingestion
$ td wf secrets --project tapad_data_ingestion --set sftp.password
```

### Prepare database and tables
You need to have following database and tables to run this workflow. If you want to change name, you need to modify setting in [tapad_data_ingestion.dig](tapad_data_ingestion.dig) file accordingly.

```
$ td db:create tapad
$ td table:create tapad dga
$ td table:create tapad id_map
$ td table:create tapad idfa
$ td table:create tapad adid
```


## Schedule
Tapad DGA file is delivered every Wednesday around midnight. So this workflow is scheduled every Thursday in case of unexpected dalay. 

## How it works

1. Get Tapad DGA file from their SFTP server. Data are imported into dga table.
2. Make id mapping data between cookies and device ids(IDFA/ADID) with N-to-N array mapping format in id_map table.
3. Make id mapping data between cookies and IDFAs with 1-to-1 format in idfa table.

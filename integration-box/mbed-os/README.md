# Sending Data from Mbed OS to Treasure Data

**[Arm Mbed OS](https://www.mbed.com/en/platform/mbed-os/)** is an open-source embedded operating system designed especially for building IoT systems.

Sending data from Mbed OS-enabled devices to Treasure Data allows you to conduct advanced analytics, gain a deeper insight into the physical world, create a variety of data-driven applications, and make business outcomes by integrating with different data sources such as customer attributes and their behavioral data.

## Overview

This Box shows an example of ingesting device heap information to Treasure Data via HTTPS REST API endpoint over WiFi:

![mbed-td](./images/mbed-td.png)

Depending on the functionalities of your device (i.e., sensors attached to your device) and code running on Mbed OS, we can collect various physical signals such as environmental conditions.

## Usage

### Configuration

First and foremost, create `mbed_app.json` based on [`mbed_app.sample.json`](./mbed_app.sample.json), and set `td_apikey`, `td_database`, and `td_table` config values properly.

This Box assumes [DISCO-F413ZH](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Discovery-F413H/) as an Mbed-enabled device, and we connect the board to the internet via its ISM43362 WiFi module; `SSID` and `PASSWORD` should be updated based on your WiFi environment. If you are using a different board or network drivers (e.g., Ethernet, Cellular), change the config setting in `mbed_app.json`.

### Installation

This Box uses [`mbed-cli`](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli) for compilation:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure your system has [`hg`](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/doc/hg.1.html), a CLI to the Mercurial code management system.

Next, download [GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) and configure a path as follows:

```sh
mbed config -G GCC_ARM_PATH "/path/to/GNU Tools ARM Embedded/bin"
```

### Connecting a device

Connect the board to your machine, and check if it can be detected by the Mbed CLI:

```sh
mbed detect
```

For instance, the command returns:

```
[mbed] Detected "DISCO_F413ZH" connected to "/Volumes/DIS_F413ZH" and using com port "/dev/tty.usbmodem145103"
```

### Compilation

Install dependent Mbed libraries:

```sh
mbed deploy
```

Compile the Box code, and enter to a serial terminal:

```sh
mbed compile --target auto --toolchain GCC_ARM --flash --sterm
```

The terminal tells you that device heap information is being collected and sent to [Treasure Data Postback API](https://docs.treasuredata.com/display/public/PD/Postback+API):

```

```

Eventually, the data becomes available in your Treasure Data table.
